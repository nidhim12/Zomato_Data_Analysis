# Zomato Data Analysis
Restaurants from all over the world can be found in Bengaluru. From United States to Japan, Russia to Antarctica, you get every cuisine here. Bengaluru is one of the best places for foodies. 
The number of restaurants is increasing day by day. Currently it stands at approximately 12,000 restaurants. 
The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurant at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant. 

## During my analysis I want to analyze and answer the following questions and more:
- i. Does the location of the restaurant affect the cost of the meal?
- 2. Does a category of restaurant receive higher ratings compared to other?
- 3. Do restaurants with online ordering receive higher ratings?
- 4. Does the rating affect the price of the restaurant?
- 5. Do restaurants with online ordering receive a greater number of votes?
- 6. Which locality of the city serves the maximum number of restaurants?
- 7. Is a location more famous for a cuisine (Veg or Non - Veg)?
- 8. Which cuisine is most popular in Bangalore?
